# Connect-4-AI
A Connect-4 game simulation where a player plays against the computer that uses a minimax algorithm which is one of the fundamental concepts in Artificial Intelligence 

It uses no fancy libraries except math and copy which is used to make a deep copy of an array, It works on the minimax algorithm which constructs a tree of all the possible moves and evaluates the best-case scenario based on the depth mentioned

We also use a pruning technique to reduce the runtime 

The entire board is essentially a 2-D array and the score evaluated is based on how many connecting pieces will be established upon making a move
